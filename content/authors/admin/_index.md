# About me

I am an energy and environmental economist broadly interested in how to effectively address climate change. My current work focuses on three streams: improving our understanding of how consumers respond to information and incentives in their energy use and conservation decisions, how the substitution between transport modes within international trade impacts trade flows and the regulation of carbon emissions from international transportation, and on how investment carbon-footprints relate to physical carbon emissions.
