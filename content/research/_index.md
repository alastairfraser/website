Students: I have two empirical projects currently available if you are looking to get research experience, or for an honours project topic. The first is a replication and then extension of a paper on how changes in competition affected air transport costs. The second is on modeling low-carbon investment portfolios. I expect both to lead to a publication. I'm also happy to chat about research ideas of your own. If you're interested, please get in touch.
