## Info for prospective students

I have several projects related to my research which might be suitable for an honours or MEcA thesis, or for an undergraduate student wishing to gain experience with empirical work. These projects include using detailed high frequency electricity data to study household behaviour, measuring the scale of carbon emissions from international trade, and investigating low-carbon and high ESG investment funds. If you're interested, please get in touch. I unfortunately do not have any paid RA opportunities at this time.
