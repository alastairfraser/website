<p>We hear a lot about plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet comparably little about how poorly we’ve lived up to past commitments. It’s worth taking a look at our past (in)actions and goals as they’re important context in which to view current progress.</p>
<p>It’s not an optimistic picture. Without a change in direction the Paris target is well on track to joining past failed targets, with voters and politicians again kicking the climate can down the road as a problem for future generations to pay the growing costs of.</p>
<p>First, here’s Canada greenhouse gas emissions (excluding land-use change &amp; related sources (LULUCF) — more on that later) since 1990, its greenhouse gas reduction targets, and projections of future emissions.</p>
<p><img src="/post/AUCDN_targets/CanAUGHGs_blog_v1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions rose in the 90’s, and have been pretty flat ever since. I’ve plotted two projections of future emissions from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/seventh-national-communication-third-biennial-report.html">Environment Canada’s Third Biennial Report.</a> The orange “Projected: 2017 Policies” shows expected greenhouse gas emissions with policies that were in place by September 2017, which excludes the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate — PM Justin Trudeau’s signature climate plan. The green “Projected: Planned Policies” includes most of the policies in the Pan-Canadian Framework, showing how the Framework is expected to be an excellent first step towards meeting the Paris target. If the current <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-carbon-tax-just-try-them/">widespread pressure from conservatives</a> to reduce, or drop entirely, Canada’s climate change efforts do not come to pass, then I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll finally see some real reductions in emissions.</p>
<p>What’s certainly not missing from this picture are laudable climate targets. The Canadian and Australian governments have made public statements on five greenhouse gas reduction targets, labeled accordingly above. The grey lines on the figure show a straight path starting from when the targets entered into force (or was announced, in the case of the Toronto target), to the reduction target itself.</p>
<p>The Paris target clearly comes from a long pedigree of moving climate goal posts. While most of these targets will sound familiar, the Toronto target is rarely mentioned but particularly interesting given current politics. Arguably the first Canadian greenhouse gas emission reduction target, it resulted from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/science/norway-and-canada-call-for-pact-to-protect-atmosphere.html">Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere</a> supported by the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. It’s the only international target adopted unofficially by the Canadian and Australian governments without a signed multilateral agreement</p>
<div id="the-picture-down-under" class="section level4">
<h4>The picture down-under</h4>
<p>Australia has a broadly similar track record of rising (non-LULUCF) greenhouse gas emissions, repeatedly moving climate target goal posts, and no substantive progress towards achieving the targets.</p>
<p><img src="/post/AUCDN_targets/CanAUGHGs_blog_v1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>How then, does Australia claim that it has <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/publications/factsheet-australias-2030-climate-change-target"><em>“a proud history of meeting and beating our international commitments on climate change”</em></a>?</p>
<p>The reason hinges on how greenhouse gas emissions from changes in the natural environment, called land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) are accounted for. These can be be a large share of a countries GHG emissions, such as occurred in Australia due to deforestation in the 1990’s, or negative emissions (e.g., from reforestation) in Canada. LULUCF emissions are defined differently for different reduction targets, countries can sometimes choose whether to include LULUCF emissions towards their targets, and reduction targets are defined in percentage terms — not specific emission levels — all of which makes comparing targets and countries a bit challenging.</p>
<p><img src="/post/AUCDN_targets/CanAUGHGs_blog_v1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>LULUCF change emissions are particularly important to Australia and the Kyoto protocol. Australia negotiated one of the weakest Kyoto targets — an increase of 8% over 1990 emissions by 2008-2012, compared to the Canadian Kyoto target (later abandoned by the government of Stephen Harper) of a 6% decrease. In, addition Australia also helped negotiate Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol — sometimes called the “Australia clause” — that made their official target easy to achieve. This is covered well <a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-hit-its-kyoto-target-but-it-was-more-a-three-inch-putt-than-a-hole-in-one-44731">here</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/factcheck-has-australia-met-its-climate-goals-while-other-nations-make-airy-fairy-promises-44656">here</a>. The Australia clause allowed countries with positive emissions from deforestation in 1990, like Australia had, to include some of these emissions in setting their 1990 baseline from which emission reductions are calculated. But by the time the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997, Australia knew that deforestation emissions had already greatly declined. Australia in effect received credit for having already reduced its substantial deforestation rates, allowing them increase fossil fuel and other emissions even more. As a result, Australia’s official baseline and official Kyoto target are shown below labeled with the Australia clause. This is how Australia successfully met their Kyoto target while simultaneously expanding emissions from fossil fuels.</p>
